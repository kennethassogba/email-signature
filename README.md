## Instructions
All the images in the signature need to be hosted somewhere like Google Drive.\
I had to change the sharing link provided by Google to include uc?id= at the beginning of the GET request in the URL.\
This allows for a direct download from Google Drive and makes sure the image appears correctly in the email signature.

### For Gmail
You will have to copy the rendered HTML signature into Gmail. 
1.  Open your HTML file in a browser.
2.  Highlight the signature with your cursor, copy.
3.  Then paste it into your Gmail signature (“Settings” -> “General”).

### For desktop email client (Outlook, ...)
Copy and paste the actual code into the email client settings.
